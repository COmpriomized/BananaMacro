# Experiment: Macro Trigger Classification

**Date:** 2025-10-25  
**Model:** banana-ai-v1  
**Goal:** Classify macro trigger intent from user input text  
**Dataset:** 500 labeled Discord commands  
**Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1

## Observations
- Model performs best on short commands with clear intent
- Confidence drops on ambiguous or multi-intent phrases
- Needs better handling of negation ("don't trigger macro")

## Next Steps
- Add more negative samples
- Try fine-tuning with contrastive loss
